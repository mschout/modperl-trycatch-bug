This is a test suite to demonstrate a TryCatch related bug that happens under
mod_perl since perl version 5.19.7, specifically since perl commit 437e3a7.

To reproduce this bug/error:
     - install perl 5.19.7 or later (at this time, I tested all versions up
       to 5.20.3 and they all fail the test. 5.22.x is not yet compatible
       with mod_perl).
     - install apache 2.2.x and mod_perl (I tested with 2.0.9)
     - install TryCatch from CPAN
     - run this test suite:

         perl Makefile.PL
         make test

Under perl versions 5.19.7 or later, the tests will fail, and you will see a
panic message similar to the following in t/logs/error_log:

 panic: attempt to copy freed scalar 7f97f7f6ab68 to 7f97f7f6aa90 at /..../Apache/TryCatch.pm line 20
